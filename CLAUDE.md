# CalorieIQ — Project Guide

This file is the standing context for working on CalorieIQ. Read it at the start of every
session. Keep it updated when architecture or decisions change.

## What CalorieIQ is

A nutrition + fitness planning web app that is the foundation of a **Shopify-style SaaS
platform** for personal trainers and their clients. Kevin (the owner) runs Smooth Training, a
mobile fitness business in Miami, which serves as the flagship proof-of-concept. Independent
trainers/businesses will eventually white-label the platform under their own brand. Kevin earns
as both platform owner and an active trainer.

Existing business tooling: Smooth Training currently runs on Trainerize (coaching delivery),
Acuity (scheduling), and Stripe (post-session billing). CalorieIQ is building toward being the
unified platform that complements and eventually replaces these.

## Tech stack

- **Vite + React (JSX).** Main UI is a single large component in `src/App.jsx` (~7,500 lines).
- **Firebase**: Authentication (Email/Password, Google, Anonymous enabled) + Cloud Firestore.
- **Hosting**: Vercel. Pushing to `main` on GitHub (kevcam51/calorieiq) auto-deploys.
- Firebase project ID: `calorieiq-29762`. Firestore is in `nam5` (multi-region), Production mode.

## Key commands

- `npm run dev` — local dev server (Vite, usually http://localhost:5173).
- `npm run build` — production build; must pass before committing.
- `npm run test:rules` — Firestore security-rules tests against the Firebase emulator. The
  emulator needs Java (Temurin JDK); if missing, install it before running.

## Important files

- `src/firebase.js` — initializes Firebase; exports `auth`, `db`, `googleProvider`. Config comes
  from `VITE_FIREBASE_*` env vars (`.env.local` locally; same vars set in Vercel for prod).
- `src/storage.js` — backs `window.storage` with Firestore at `users/{uid}/kv/{key}`. The whole
  app reads/writes through this. **Do not change the `window.storage` interface**
  (get/set/delete/list) — App.jsx depends on it.
- `src/AuthGate.jsx` — gates the app behind login; captures role at signup; ensures every user
  has a profile before the app mounts.
- `src/profile.js` — user profile + role helpers (`createProfile`, `getProfile`, `joinTrainer`,
  `getMyClients`, `getMySubTrainers`, `myInviteCode`, `ROLES`).
- `firestore.rules` — security rules (access control). Tested by `npm run test:rules`.
- `docs/BLAZE_MIGRATION.md` — the planned upgrade path to Firebase custom claims (future).
- `.env.local` — Firebase config; **gitignored**, never commit. Vercel has its own copy.

## Data model

- `users/{uid}` (profile doc): `uid`, `email`, `displayName`, `role`, `assignedTrainerId`,
  `headTrainerId`, `createdAt`. Reserved for later: `trialStartedAt`, `trialLengthDays`,
  `subscriptionStatus`.
- `users/{uid}/kv/{key}` — the app's per-user data (managed via `storage.js`).
- Roles: `client`, `head_trainer`, `sub_trainer`, `admin`.

## Security model (current)

- Roles stored in the profile doc; enforced by `firestore.rules` (document `get()` checks).
- Access matrix: a user's `kv` data is read/writable by the owner, an admin, the owner's direct
  trainer (`assignedTrainerId`), or the head above that trainer. Self-promotion is blocked
  (users can't change their own `role`). Admin is hardcoded by **UID** in `isAdmin()` (admin =
  Kevin's account UID; tied to the account, not the email — changing email/password keeps admin).
- **Security rules are critical.** Any change to `firestore.rules` MUST be covered by emulator
  tests (`npm run test:rules`) — including attack cases (no self-promotion, no cross-trainer or
  cross-client access, signed-out denied) — and must pass before committing. After changing
  rules, they must be PUBLISHED in the Firebase console (or via `firebase deploy --only
  firestore:rules`) — a code push alone does not update live access control.

## Future hardening (see docs/BLAZE_MIGRATION.md)

When the project moves to the Firebase **Blaze** (pay-as-you-go) plan — which is required for
Cloud Functions, and therefore for Stripe webhooks, the AI coaching layer, and Cloud Storage —
migrate role checks to **custom claims** (tamper-proof, set by a Cloud Function, free/instant to
read in rules vs. billed `get()`s). The data model and app logic stay the same; only a Cloud
Function + a rules tweak are added. Always set a Cloud Billing budget + alerts the day Blaze is
enabled (Blaze has no default spending cap).

## Current state (built)

- Session 1: Vite project, app moved in, deployed to Vercel.
- Session 2: Firebase Auth + Firestore; storage migrated from localStorage to Firestore;
  login gate; per-user data isolation.
- Session 3: Four-role system; role chosen at signup ("trainer" → head_trainer; "client" →
  client; sub_trainer = admin-assigned for now; admin = hardcoded UID). Trainer-sees-their-
  clients access in the rules, with 29 passing emulator tests. Minimal in-app role panel
  (trainer sees invite code + linked clients; client joins via invite code). Blaze migration
  path documented.
- Session 4: **Friendly invite codes.** Trainers now get a short, readable code (7 chars, no
  ambiguous O/0/I/1/L, displayed as `XXX-XXXX`) stored on their profile (`inviteCode` field);
  clients link by entering it and it's resolved back to the trainer's uid at join time. Raw-uid
  entry still works as a fallback for codes shared under the old scheme, and `joinTrainer` now
  validates the target is actually a trainer before linking. No `firestore.rules` change was
  needed (lookup uses the already-open signed-in read; the code is written by the trainer to
  their own profile). Helpers added to `profile.js`: `ensureInviteCode`, `formatInviteCode`.
- Session 5: **Display names, leave/switch trainer, and one-click invite links.**
  (1) **Display name** is now captured at signup (a name field on the signup form and the
  one-time role chooser) — **required for trainers**, optional for clients — and editable
  anytime from the role panel. Stored in the profile's `displayName`; the client view shows the
  trainer's name (falling back to email, then uid). (2) **Leave / switch trainer:** clients get
  a "Leave trainer" button that clears `assignedTrainerId`; switching is leave-then-join-a-new-
  code. (3) **Invite links:** trainers can copy a `…/?invite=CODE` link; when a client opens it
  and signs up/in (and isn't already linked), the app auto-links them and confirms on screen
  (guarded to clients only, never overrides an existing link, and the code is stripped from the
  URL after). All three are owner self-writes, so **no `firestore.rules` change** was needed.
  Helpers added to `profile.js`: `setDisplayName`, `leaveTrainer`.
- Session 6: **Name refinements + leave confirmation.** Names are now captured as separate
  **first / last** fields (stored as `firstName`, `lastName`, plus the combined `displayName`
  for back-compat) on signup, the role chooser, and the role-panel editor; both required for
  trainers. The "Leave trainer" button now asks for an inline **Confirm / Cancel** before
  unlinking, to prevent accidental leaves. Helpers added to `profile.js`: `setName`, `splitName`
  (and `splitName` falls back to splitting an older single `displayName`). Still owner
  self-writes — no `firestore.rules` change.
- Session 7: **Trainer overview dashboard (Phase 1, non-Blaze).** Trainers now land on a new
  **Dashboard** home tab: a per-client overview card showing weight → goal (with "lbs to go"),
  the daily calorie target (computed with the SAME formula as the Results "Target calories" row),
  last activity (most recent daily log), and a plan-status badge (complete / in progress / needs
  setup), plus a sort (needs attention / last active / name) and a summary line. A two-tab toggle
  (**Dashboard | All clients**) flips to the existing profile/folder manager, which is unchanged.
  Built entirely on existing per-profile data + daily logs (`computeClientCalories` reuses the
  in-file calc functions; one `storage.list("caliq-log-")` call gets last-active). New in App.jsx:
  `computeClientCalories`, `TrainerDashboard`; App now reads the user's `role` to default trainers
  into the dashboard. No data-model change, no `firestore.rules` change, no Blaze. The card shows
  weight → goal with "N lbs to go" (larger/brighter text, `lbs` on every number), plus a **progress
  bar** that fills using the client's *earliest weigh-in check-in* as the starting baseline — the
  bar only appears once there's at least one weigh-in to measure against, so it's never misleading.
- Session 8 (in progress): **Connecting accounts to profiles — linking (Phase 1, non-Blaze).**
  First slice of the "two kinds of client" work. New file `src/clientData.js` adds cross-account
  kv access (`getForUser`/`setForUser`/`deleteForUser`/`listForUser`) — a separate accessor that
  takes a target uid and works ONLY where `firestore.rules` already grant trainer→client access;
  it does NOT touch the `window.storage` interface. In the role panel, each linked client now
  shows a plan status ("✓ Plan linked" / "No plan yet") and a **Link a profile** action: the
  trainer picks one of their own saved profiles and its data is copied into the *client's* account
  under the key `caliq-self` (so both can later edit the single shared copy). Both actions are
  guarded by inline confirmations — "Link [profile] to [client]?" and a red **Unlink** with "Unlink
  [client]'s plan? This removes it from their account." No `firestore.rules` change (relies on the
  existing trainer↔client kv access; verified by a real linked test account).
  **Client home added:** a signed-in **client** now lands on a `ClientHome` screen (role panel +
  an "Open my plan" button) instead of the trainer's profile manager; opening it runs
  `selectProfile("self")`, which reuses the existing editor on the key `caliq-self` (since
  `profileKey("self")` === `caliq-self`) in the client's *own* storage — so the plan a trainer
  linked is the very same file the client opens and edits (one shared copy; created on the client's
  first save if none was linked). Header buttons relabel for clients ("My Home" / "← Home").
  **Part C done:** the trainer can now OPEN a linked client's plan and edit it live. Each linked
  client with a plan shows an **"Open plan"** button in the role panel; it calls `openClientPlan(uid)`,
  which loads the client's `caliq-self` via `getForUser` into the normal editor and sets a new
  `activeRemoteUid` state. `autoSave` branches on `activeRemoteUid`: when set, edits save via
  `setForUser(uid, "caliq-self", …)` straight into the client's account (and skip the local index
  update); when null, it's the existing local-profile behavior. `selectProfile`, `createProfile`,
  and `goToProfiles` all reset `activeRemoteUid` to null so local editing is never misrouted. So the
  trainer and client now edit one shared copy from both sides. **Still optional:** an explicit
  auto-create of `caliq-self` on join (today it's created on first edit), and enriching ClientHome
  with a plan summary. Assumption: one shared "self" plan per client (multiple plans per client is a
  later roadmap item).
- **Known state:** there are test accounts and test client profiles in Firestore from manual
  testing — these are not real users and can be cleared.

## Roadmap (not yet built)

- **Planned rebrand:** "CalorieIQ" and most "Cal-" prefixed names are crowded in the app stores;
  a more distinctive name/domain may replace it later. No code impact — the Firebase project ID
  stays `calorieiq-29762` regardless, so this is a UI-text + domain change whenever it happens.

- Role-aware dashboards: **Trainer overview shipped (Session 7).** Still to do: the **Client
  Dashboard** (a client's own home view) and connecting a linked client *account* to a managed
  nutrition *profile* (the "two kinds of client" gap — in progress; one shared "self" plan in the
  client's account, both can edit; no Blaze).
- **Multiple plans per client (later enhancement).** Default is one plan per client; this adds the
  option of several, with one marked active. Useful cases: diet/training **phases** (cut →
  maintenance → bulk; or hypertrophy → strength → peak/power mesocycles); **goal-specific**
  programs (marathon training vs. strength); **seasonal/periodized** (off-season vs. contest prep,
  incl. peak week); **draft vs. active** (prep next month's plan while they follow the current one);
  **history** (keep finished plans as records instead of overwriting); **injury/rehab** modified
  program during recovery; **travel/vacation** lighter or bodyweight-only block; **reverse-diet**
  after a cut; **progression templates** (beginner → intermediate → advanced); **split variants**
  (push/pull/legs vs. upper/lower) to switch between; **reusable plan templates / a plan library**
  the trainer clones across clients; **medical/dietary-restriction variants**; and **A/B approaches**
  to see what works for a given client. No Blaze needed — it's a data-model + UI change (a list of
  plans per client with an "active" flag).
- **Requests / to-dos between trainer and client (Kevin's idea).** Either side can send the other a
  small actionable request that surfaces on the recipient's home screen. Trainer → client examples:
  "enter your name," "log today's food," "record your workout," "do a weigh-in." It pops up as a
  task card on the client's home; the client fills it in. Client → trainer examples: "please enter
  this for me," "record this food/workout for me." Trainer-side display: a little request badge next
  to that client's folder; requests from **non-clients** (not linked) collect under a "Requests"
  section on the trainer home. Trainers can **turn off receiving requests**, especially from
  non-clients. Notifications are a later add-on (see notification center). **Blaze split:** the
  **trainer → client** direction is doable **non-Blaze** (the trainer already has write access to the
  client's account, so the request is written into the client's kv, e.g. `caliq-requests`). The
  **client → trainer** direction is NOT possible safely without server-side logic — a client can't
  write into the trainer's account under the current rules — so it needs **Cloud Functions / Blaze**
  (same constraint as notifications/messaging). Recommend building the trainer→client half now and
  the client→trainer half with Blaze. Store requests as structured items (id, from, to, type,
  prompt, status open/done, timestamps).
- **Edit history / activity log (who-changed-what).** Since both trainer and client edit the same
  shared plan, track every meaningful change as an append-only event: **who** (uid + role + name),
  **when** (timestamp), **what** (e.g. "added a meal," "logged 182 lbs," "changed goal to 160,"
  "edited Tuesday cardio"), and ideally the before→after. Surface it as a **timeline/feed** on the
  profile or dashboard. Value: accountability + coaching insight (is the client logging daily?),
  and it resolves the "who overwrote whom" risk of shared editing (could later enable revert). It
  also feeds the future **notification center** (notify trainer when a client logs). Store as
  structured events (not raw diffs) for readability, and log meaningful actions rather than every
  keystroke. **Two tiers:** a basic *cooperative* history can be done **non-Blaze** (each side
  writes its own events into the shared plan's history) — but it's not tamper-proof (a writer could
  forge/omit entries). A **trustworthy, tamper-resistant** audit trail (authoritative server
  timestamps, can't fake another user's identity) needs **Cloud Functions → Blaze**. Recommend the
  basic version alongside the shared-editing work, with the hardened version arriving with Blaze.
- **Consistency-based time-to-goal estimate** — as the trainer (or client) logs weight + body-fat
  % over time, use the *actual* observed rate of change (not just the theoretical 1 lb/wk deficit
  the app currently assumes) to project a realistic ETA to goal weight / goal BF%. Builds on the
  existing check-in/daily-log data. Could feed a real progress bar on the dashboard card (Kevin:
  progress bar is optional/aesthetic — only worth it if it improves the look; "lbs to go" is fine
  on its own for now). No Blaze needed.
- **Navigation side menu** — a hamburger (≡) menu in the top corner that opens a slide-out
  panel for editing your profile and moving around the app. Its own UI step (App.jsx is one
  large component, so navigation restructuring should be planned carefully). No Blaze needed.
- **Notification center** — notify a trainer when a client joins or leaves (and similar events).
  Deferred until Blaze/Cloud Functions: a client safely creating a notification on the trainer's
  side needs server-side logic (client-side writes would require opening up the rules unsafely).
- **In-app messaging** — direct messages between a trainer and their clients. Deferred until
  Blaze/Cloud Functions: a shared conversation between two users needs server-side writes (or
  carefully designed new rules) to stay secure.
- **Two trial periods**: self-serve client trial (~7–14 days) and trainer migration trial
  (~30 days). Store trial state per-user (the reserved profile fields above); gate features at
  expiry. Anonymous auth is the frictionless entry point.
- **Head-invites-sub onboarding with consent** — deferred until Blaze/Cloud Functions (doing it
  safely needs server-side logic; client-side would create an escalation hole).
- **Stripe Connect** revenue splits (two-level tree: sub keeps 75%, head 10%, platform 15%;
  direct clients: trainer 85%, platform 15%; capped at 2 levels). Needs Blaze.
- **AI coaching layer** on the Anthropic API (server-side via Cloud Function — never expose the
  key in the browser): daily messages, AI meal tracking from photos, reminders, weekly reports.
- **Meal logging** tiers: free self-log; trainer manual-entry with AI assist; premium AI
  auto-track. Food APIs: FatSecret (primary), USDA FoodData Central, Nutritionix; wearables via
  Apple Health / Google Health Connect (Fitbit, Garmin, Whoop, Oura). Wearable data overrides
  scheduled estimates when connected.

## How to work on this project (working agreements)

- **Explain in plain language.** Kevin is building real skills but isn't a deep engineer — narrate
  what you're doing and why.
- **Pause before anything irreversible or live-affecting.** Always confirm before: committing,
  pushing to `main` (auto-deploys to prod), deleting files, or changing access rules. Show what
  you're about to do first.
- **Security-rule changes**: always write/run emulator tests and pass them before committing;
  remind Kevin to publish the rules.
- **Don't break the storage interface** or push secrets. `.env.local` stays gitignored.
- **Commit style**: clear, descriptive messages; keep unrelated changes in separate commits.
- Build (`npm run build`) should pass before committing code changes.
- Keep this file (CLAUDE.md) updated as the project evolves.
