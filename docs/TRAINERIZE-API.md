# Trainerize API — capabilities + how Glide can use it (logged for later)

_Kevin has a **Studio account** and pulled the full API reference (v03, ~290 pages). He wants this
logged now and built later. This is the reference + the plan — nothing implemented yet._

## Basics
- **Base:** `https://api.trainerize.com/v03/…` — REST, JSON, all **POST**.
- **Auth:** HTTP **Basic** (base64), per **Group API token**. Access is scoped by credential
  (a client credential can only read its own data; a group/trainer token reads the group's clients).
- **Rate limit (Kevin's plan):** **1,000 requests / minute per Group API token**. Exceeding →
  `429 Too Many Requests` ("API Rate Limit Exceeded"). → the importer must page + throttle (stay well
  under 1000/min; batch by client).
- **Errors seen in docs:** `403 Not authorized` (credential scope), `404 User not found`, `500`.

## Endpoint map (124 endpoints) — what's useful to Glide
- **Clients:** `user/getClientList`, `user/getProfile`, `user/getClientSummary`, `user/getTrainerList`,
  `user/getSettings`, `user/getLoginToken`, `user/getSetupLink` → roster + full profiles + onboarding links.
- **Body stats:** `bodystats/get` (+ add/set/delete) → weight + measurement history, units selectable.
- **Nutrition:** `dailyNutrition/get`, `dailyNutrition/getList`, `mealPlan/get`, `dailyNutrition/getCustomFoodList`
  → logged food per day, meal plans, custom foods.
- **Workouts / programs:** `program/get`/`getList`/`getUserProgramList`/`getCalendarList`,
  `trainingPlan/*`, `workoutDef/get`, `dailyWorkout/get`, `dailyCardio/get`, `exercise/get` → full programs,
  scheduled + completed workouts, cardio detail (distance/duration), exercise library.
- **Health / wearables:** **`healthData/getList`** — `type` ∈ **step, restingHeartRate, sleep,
  bloodPressure, calorieOut** over a date range; **`healthData/getListSleep`**. Trainerize already
  aggregates clients' connected wearables → we can read **calories burned (calorieOut)** + steps + sleep
  without building our own Fitbit/Apple/Garmin OAuth.
- **Goals / adherence:** `goal/get`/`getList`/`setProgress`, `compliance/getUserCompliance`,
  `compliance/getGroupCompliance` → client goals + adherence %.
- **Photos / notes / messaging:** `photos/getList`/`getByID`, `trainerNote/*`, `message/*` → progress
  photos, coaching notes, DMs.
- **Org:** `userGroup/*`, `userTag/*`, `appointment/*`, `habits/*`, `challenge/*`.

## How Glide can use it (ranked)
1. **One-click client + history migration (headline).** `getClientList` → per client pull `getProfile`,
   `bodystats/get`, `goal/get`, `dailyNutrition/get`, `program/get` → create/populate their Glide plan
   with history intact. Removes the biggest barrier to switching off Trainerize; later a recruiting hook
   for other trainers ("import your Trainerize clients in one click").
2. **Calories-burned / activity via `healthData.calorieOut`.** Feed the already-aggregated burn + steps
   into Glide's progress/TDEE — a shortcut to the fitness-tracker goal in `TRACKER-INTEGRATION.md` without
   per-wearable OAuth. (Caveat: only for clients using Trainerize's wearable links, and while on Trainerize.)
3. **Program + exercise-library import.** Bring his templates/exercises over so he doesn't rebuild.
4. **Transitional parallel run.** Pull weigh-ins, workout completion, compliance into Glide dashboards
   during migration so he can run both.

## Multi-tenant: every trainer brings their OWN Trainerize token (Kevin's Q)
The API is **per-Group-token**, and a token only sees **its own group's clients**. So this isn't
Kevin-only — it's naturally multi-tenant:
- **Each Glide trainer connects their own Trainerize Group API token** (from their Trainerize settings)
  via a "Connect Trainerize" screen. Glide then imports **that trainer's** clients — trainer A's token
  never sees trainer B's data (Trainerize enforces the scope).
- **Rate limits are per-token** (1000/min each), so trainers don't share a budget — it scales cleanly.
- This turns migration into a **platform acquisition hook**: any incoming trainer on Trainerize can
  one-click import their roster + history into Glide.
- **Requirement:** the trainer needs **API access on their Trainerize plan** (Studio/higher tiers).
  Trainers without it fall back to CSV / manual / AI-paste import.
- **Security (important):** these are third-party credentials we'd store on the trainer's behalf. Store
  them **server-side only, encrypted / in a restricted store the browser can't read back**, decrypt only
  inside the Cloud Function, validate on connect (a test call), and let the trainer disconnect/delete.
  Do NOT store raw tokens in a client-readable Firestore field. (Kevin's single token today can be a
  Secret; the multi-tenant version needs the per-trainer encrypted store.)

## Build plan (when we pick it up — READ-ONLY importer)
- A Cloud Function (Blaze) storing the **Group API token as a Secret** (like RESEND/ANTHROPIC).
- Map Trainerize fields → Glide schema: profile→`data`, bodystats→`checkIns`/weight, goals→goal fields,
  dailyNutrition→`caliq-log-{plan}-{date}.meals[]`, program→`data.cardio`/`data.strength`,
  healthData.calorieOut→a per-day burn we fold into progress.
- Throttle to stay < 1000 req/min; page client-by-client; dedupe on re-import; label imported data's source.
- **Confirm before build:** exactly what the Studio Group API token can read (whole client group?),
  and get the token from Kevin (stored as a secret, never in the repo).

**Status: NOT started — reference + plan only. Kevin wants to build this later.**
